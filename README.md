### Description

Turn your VB5/6 Application into a WINDOWS SERVICE that can run in the background without you even logging into your computer - just like Anti-Virus applications do!<br><br>

Enclosed are two demonstrations of what you can do... one being a CPU monitor (mainly to show you how to interact with services using the MS Windows Service Manager) and the second being a very simple web server - BOTH projects are from PSC and were mildly updated to become services! (See the enclosed README for author credits and links.)<br><br>

Included with this project is the source and compiled control (Again, see the README for instructions.) The source for the VB projects should be rather straight-forward (the sections where we've added service control are commented - the 3rd party apps; please see their postings here at PSC.)<br><br>

Q: Why do I need a custom control to create services within VB?<br>

A: Visual Basic (prior to .NET) has no ability for VB to communicate properly with the Windows Service Manager on a stable framework. Worse yet, for those of you accustomed to using NtSVC from Microsoft years ago you've found that it crashes when you try to use sub-classing in your application.<br><br>

Control Source: Basic image files and such have been removed to ensure the smallest possible download. Should you wish to re-create the sources, see the resource file for the file names of the images needed and create your own!
